# ⚙️ What Is Compute in AWS?

**Compute** in AWS means the **brain power** 🧠 and **muscle** 💪 that make your apps and systems **run** and **think**.

It’s like giving your programs a **computer** with **CPUs** (for thinking) and **RAM** (for remembering things).

## 🏗️ Simple Explanation

Imagine AWS as a **giant library** 📚 full of different kinds of **computers** you can borrow.  
You pick the one you need, use it, and then give it back when you’re done.

## ☁️ Two Main Ways to Use Compute

### 🧩 AWS Lambda — *The Quick Helper*
- Great for **short tasks** that happen occasionally.  
- You don’t manage servers — AWS does it for you!  
- 🕒 **Example:** Like borrowing a book for one day — you read it, return it, and move on.

### 🖥️ Amazon EC2 — *The Long Worker*
- Perfect when you need a **computer running all the time**.  
- You can choose how powerful it is (**CPU**, **memory**, etc.).  
- 📚 **Example:** Like borrowing books for a **long project** that lasts weeks or months.

## 📝 Key Takeaways
- **Compute = Processing Power** (CPU + RAM)  
- **AWS Lambda** → short, event-based, serverless tasks  
- **Amazon EC2** → long-running virtual servers  
- **Goal:** Pick the right compute service for your workload and cost needs 💰
